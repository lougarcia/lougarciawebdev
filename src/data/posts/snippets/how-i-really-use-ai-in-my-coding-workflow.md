# How I Really Use AI in My Coding Workflow

I’ll be honest: when I first tried AI tools for coding, I expected them to magically solve everything for me. But the more I used them, the more I realized something important—AI isn’t here to replace developers. It’s here to make us faster and freer.

The key is this: you must understand the code. If you rely blindly on AI’s output without knowing what it’s doing, you’re setting yourself up for messy bugs, security issues, or worse—a project you can’t even maintain.

So I don’t use AI to think for me. I use it to type for me.

For example, I spend zero time creating mockup data anymore. Need 200 rows of JSON with realistic names and emails? AI does it instantly. Before, I’d waste half an hour generating and formatting that by hand. Now, I’m testing features almost immediately.

Another big one: the little utility functions. Converting dates, shuffling arrays, cleaning up strings. Honestly, I could write them in my sleep—but do I want to? Not really. **I use AI to write code I already understand, but don’t feel like writing**. That’s my golden rule.

It feels like having an assistant who handles the tedious parts while I focus on the architecture, the design, and the “big picture” decisions. And because I understand what the code is doing, I can tweak it, refactor it, or even scrap it if I see a better way.

This approach has actually made me more ambitious. I start side projects more often, because I know I won’t get bogged down in boilerplate or setup hell. Instead of burning out on the boring stuff, I save my energy for the features that really matter.

The result? Coding feels fun again. It’s less about typing endless lines of code, and more about building ideas.

So here’s my advice: don’t hand over your brain to AI. **Use it as a tool for the parts you’re too lazy to write—but never for the parts you don’t understand**. That’s how you keep your skills sharp while still enjoying the speed and convenience AI brings.

At the end of the day, AI should amplify your creativity, not replace it.
